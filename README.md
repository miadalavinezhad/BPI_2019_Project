# Process mining for BPI challenge 2019

In this project I have done a thorough analysis of the event log provided by a large multinational company operating from The Netherlands in the area of coatings and paints.
This data was part of the BPI challenge 2019 in the ninth International Business Process Intelligence Challenge that is co-located with ICPM in 2019. This challenge provides a real-life event log, to analyze these data using different techniques available, focusing on one or more of the process ownerâ€™s questions or proving other unique insights into the process(es) captured in the event log.
